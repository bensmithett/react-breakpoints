`react-breakpoints` allows you to respond to changes in a DOM element's size. You can change the evaluated logic and rendered output of components based on observed size changes in DOM elements. For example, you can change a dropdown menu to a horizontal list menu based on its parent container's width without using CSS media queries.

## üì¶ What's in the box?
> No polling. No event listening. No sentinel elements. **Just a [`ResizeObserver`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ResizeObserver)!**

This package provides you with:

* a [`<Provider>`](/docs/api.md#provider) to instantiate the ResizeObserver;
* an [`<Observe>`](/docs/api.md#observe) component to observe changes in a DOM element;
* a [`useBreakpoints()`](/docs/api.md#usebreakpoints) hook to change a component's behaviour based on the observed size information in the nearest parent `<Observe>`.

For power users this package also provides:

* a [`<Context>`](/docs/api.md#context) on which you can assign a `ResizeObserverEntry` value to update any nested components that are using `useBreakpoints()`;
* a [`useResizeObserver()`](/docs/api.md#useresizeobserver) hook to connect a DOM element in your component to the instantiated `ResizeObserver` on `<Provider>`;
* a [`useResizeObserverEntry()`](/docs/api.md#useresizeobserverentry) hook to retrieve the `ResizeObserverEntry` put on the nearest `<Context>`. This is what `useBreakpoints()` uses under the hood.

# üöß Developer status

The API of this hook is not finalised and may change at any given time.

I'm currently in the process of helping other Envatians integrate this package into their apps to mature the codebase and documentation.

# ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick start

Follow these **minimum required steps** to get started with `react-breakpoints`. This is just the tip of the iceberg, though. Check the [API Docs](/docs/api.md) for all options.

```shell
npm install @envato/react-breakpoints
```

## Set up the provider

```javascript
import { Provider as ResizeObserverProvider } from '@envato/react-breakpoints';

const App = () => (
  <ResizeObserverProvider>
    ...
  </ResizeObserverProvider>
)
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Caution**: You may need to pass some props to `<Provider>` to increase browser support. Please refer to the [API Docs](/docs/api.md#provider).

## Observe an element

```javascript
import { Observe } from '@envato/react-breakpoints';

<Observe
  render={({ observedElementProps }) => (
    <aside {...observedElementProps}>
      <MyResponsiveComponent />
    </aside>
  )}
/>
```

## Consume the observation

```javascript
import { useBreakpoints } from '@envato/react-breakpoints';

const MyResponsiveComponent = () => {
  const options = {
    widths: {
      0: 'mobile',
      769: 'tablet',
      1025: 'desktop'
    }
  };

  const [label] = useBreakpoints(options);

  return (
    <div className={label}>
      This element is currently within the {label} range.
    </div>
  );
};
```

See the [API Docs](/docs/api.md) for reference guides and usage examples.

# Observing boxes vs. Matching boxes

There is an important distinction between the `box` you're observing and `box`es triggering breakpoints. See [Observing boxes vs. Matching boxes](/docs/boxes.md) for more information.

# Server-Side Rendering

See [Server-Side Rendering](/docs/server-side-rendering.md) for more information.

1. Commit your changes (git commit -am 'Add some feature').
1. Push to the branch (git push origin my-new-feature).
1. Create a new Pull Request.

**For larger new features**: Do everything as above, but first also make contact with the project maintainers to be sure your change fits with the project direction and you won't be wasting effort going in the wrong direction.
